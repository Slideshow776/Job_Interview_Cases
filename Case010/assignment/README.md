# Chat

- Task: implement a chat client and server
- Position: front-end developer at Pexip

## Constraints

- You have to work on the task yourself, independently
- Use any programming language to implement the server
- Use either TypeScript or JavaScript for the frontend
- We recommend using native WebSocket, we would lika a solution without socket.io / Firebase
- If you're going to use a front end framework we would prefer it to be React, but use whatever framework you are most comfortable with.
- You must use a git repository and commit frequently
- No rush, please come back to us whenever you have had time to look into this
- KISS: Keep It Simple

## Evaluation

- We expect you to spend around 4 hours.
- If you get excited and want to spend more time that is perfectly fine, just make sure to tell us roughly how much time you've spent on this
- The primary goal of this exercise is to see how you work and structure your code as well as determine your technical skills.
- We want to go through the code with you in a following interview to discuss your technique and choices.

## Main tasks

- Implement a chat service, that supports at least 2 different devices at the same time
- You should be able to edit your own messages. Other particpants should see that the message was edited
- You should be able to delete your own messages. Other particpants should see that the message was deleted
- List of active participants to show who is in the session right now
- Style the chat to look like the provided design

## Bonus tasks / Additional tasks (if you have time to spare)

If you want to spend more time on this you could implement any of these features

- Image support
- Fetch URLs and display a page preview on link hover
- Emojis
- Giphy support
- Alternative layouts / themes
- End to end encryption (only the clients can read the data)

## Hints

- It might be a really good idea to test this with 2 different devices
- The design is narrow, but this is not meant to be mobile only
- Bonus tasks are additions to the main task
