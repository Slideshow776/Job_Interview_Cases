**Python Programming**

1. **Describe two different modules** for exploiting concurrency Python, pointing out the strengths
and weaknesses of each and of concurrency as a whole in Python.

2. **What does the following code print**, and why? 
```
def fn(v, lst=[]):
lst.insert(0,v)
print(lst)
fn(23)
fn(16,[1, 2])
fn([10], [3, 4])
fn([11])
```

3. **Write a python function** which, when called with a list of integers, returns the sum of the
squares of all even members of that list.
