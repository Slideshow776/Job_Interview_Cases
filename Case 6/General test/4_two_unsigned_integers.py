""" 
Task:   Write a function in a language of your choice which is passed two unsigned integers, a value
        and a base. It should print the supplied value in the supplied base. The base is in the range 2
        to 36, and digit values greater than 9 are represented in the output by the alphabetic characters
        such that 10 is 'A' etc.

Notes:  Unsigned can hold a larger positive value, and no negative value.
        Unsigned uses the leading bit as a part of the value, while the signed version uses the left-most-bit
        to identify if the number is positive or negative.
        Signed integers can hold both positive and negative numbers.

        I don't know what is meant by "It should print the supplied value in the supplied base".
