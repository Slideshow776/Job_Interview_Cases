**General Programming**

1. **The Fibonacci sequence** is defined as a sequence of integers starting with 1 and 1, where each
subsequent value is the sum of the preceding two. I.e.
f(0) = 1
f(1) = 1
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) where n >= 2
Write a program in a language of your choice to calculate the sum of the first 100 even-valued
Fibonacci numbers
2. **Describe 3 different data structures** that could be used to implement an associative array where
both the keys and values are strings, and comment on their relative advantages and
disadvantages
3. **Write a function** in a language of your choice that merges two sorted lists into a new sorted list.
E.g. [1,4,6],[2,3,5] â†’ [1,2,3,4,5,6].
4. **Write a function** in a language of your choice which is passed two unsigned integers, a value
and a base. It should print the supplied value in the supplied base. The base is in the range 2
to 36, and digit values greater than 9 are represented in the output by the alphabetic characters
such that 10 is 'A' etc.
